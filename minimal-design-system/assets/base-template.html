          In an era of digital noise and visual complexity, minimal design stands as a powerful counterpoint. It's not about removing everything—it's about finding what truly matters and presenting it with intention and clarity.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Regular Paragraphs -->
        <div class="max-w-2xl space-y-4">
          <p>
            Minimal design is often misunderstood as simply "less stuff." In reality, it requires more thought, more discipline, and a deeper understanding of hierarchy and composition. Every element must earn its place. Every pixel of whitespace serves a purpose.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The foundation of minimal design lies in typography and spacing. When you strip away decorative elements, what remains must be perfectly balanced. Line length, font size, weight, and the space between elements become the primary tools for creating visual hierarchy and guiding the reader's eye.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Whitespace—or more accurately, negative space—is not empty. It's an active element of your design. It creates breathing room, establishes relationships between elements, and directs attention. In minimal design, the space around your content is as important as the content itself.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">The Power of Constraint</h2>
        
        <div class="max-w-2xl space-y-6">
          <p>
            Constraints breed creativity. When you limit yourself to black, white, and shades of gray, you're forced to think more carefully about every decision. Color becomes a powerful accent, reserved for moments of true importance. A single splash of color in a minimal interface carries more weight than a rainbow of hues fighting for attention.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This philosophy extends beyond color to every aspect of design. Limited typography forces you to create hierarchy through size, weight, and spacing rather than font variety. A restricted component library encourages consistency and teaches you to solve problems within a framework rather than inventing new solutions for every scenario.
          </p>

          <p>
            The quote above captures the essence of minimal design. It's an iterative process of refinement, constantly asking "what can we remove?" until only the essential remains. This doesn't mean the final product is sparse or barren—it means every element that survived the editing process is there for a reason.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider the white space in this very document. The margins aren't arbitrary—they're carefully chosen to create comfortable line lengths for reading. The space between paragraphs provides visual rhythm and allows ideas to breathe. The generous padding around sections creates clear separation without requiring decorative dividers.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Second Article Section -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Typography as Foundation</h2>
        
        <div class="max-w-2xl space-y-6">
          <p>
            In minimal design, typography isn't just about choosing a nice font—it's the primary vehicle for communication and hierarchy. Without color gradients, shadows, or decorative elements to guide the eye, your typography must do all the heavy lifting.
          </p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Scale and Hierarchy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              A well-defined type scale is crucial. The difference between your heading sizes must be significant enough to establish clear hierarchy, but harmonious enough to feel like part of a unified system. Each level should have a clear purpose—H1 for page titles, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Line height and spacing between elements are equally important. Dense text feels cramped and difficult to read. Too much space feels disconnected. The goal is to find the sweet spot where related elements group naturally while distinct sections remain clearly separated.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Readable Line Lengths</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Notice how this text never exceeds about 65-75 characters per line? That's intentional. Longer lines tire the eye and make it harder to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. Shorter lines feel choppy and create awkward reading rhythm.
            </p>
            <p>
              This constraint—limiting the maximum width of text blocks—is one of the most impactful decisions you can make for readability. It's why newspapers use columns. It's why books have margins. And it's why minimal interfaces often feel more comfortable to read than their busier counterparts.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
        
        <div class="max-w-2xl space-y-4">
          <p>
            Minimal design is not a trend—it's a philosophy rooted in clarity, intentionality, and respect for the user's attention. It acknowledges that every element on the screen has a cognitive cost, and it seeks to minimize that cost while maximizing value.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As you apply these principles to your own work, remember that minimal doesn't mean cold or impersonal. A minimal interface can still be warm and inviting through thoughtful typography, generous whitespace, and careful attention to detail. The goal is not to make everything look the same—it's to strip away the unnecessary so that what remains can shine.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Start with the fundamentals: good typography, proper spacing, and clear hierarchy. Everything else should serve these foundations. And when in doubt, remember Saint-Exupéry's wisdom—keep removing until there's nothing left to take away.
          </p>
